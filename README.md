# We're Live on GitHub!
This release is a big one for us: It's the first .exe released alongside us opening up the code of the scoreboard tool! The .exe has been updated in a major way too as you can update the Gametype, Hero, Map, and Roles simply by replacing the .png and associated information file even if it is a custom property was created in a different directory or on different computer. This means you can now create custom properties once and send it to anyone else and it should work: simply replace all the files within Gametype, Hero, Map, or Role folder and relaunch the scoreboard tool.

# How do I use it?
1. Follow the instructions to install the Modern Package or Legacy Package here: https://broadcast.gg/broadcast-package/
2. Download the OW_Scoreboard_Tool.2020.11.02.zip file attached and replace the .exe from the installation instructions with this updated one
3. For the Modern Package, download the v1.0.Modern.Package.Hero.Folder.2020.11.02.zip file and replace the entire contents of the >Scoreboard>Heroes folder with the files from this package. These files are needed to format correctly for the team roster pictures

# Why Open Source?
The future of esports is an abundance of sustainable gaming communities who come together over their favorite titles and competition. Esports broadcasts will serve a key part of that future, and this is the first step. This release is our best yet thanks to the team who collaborated on this, but we want to kick things up a notch by inviting even more collaborators to take this and make it their own. This is our first step towards there being a tool that works for multiple esports and delivers high quality, community level broadcasts to help make make sustainable gaming communities possible.

# What's Next?
Ultimately we want to rewrite the tool so it is even more powerful. But for now we are excited to open this project up to collaborators to contribute to the front and back end. We're still working our way around GitHub to figure out the best way to maintain this but we are looking forward to seeing all the forks and contributions.
